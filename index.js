// Code your solution in this file!

// Step 1: Declare companyName as a constant
// We use 'const' because the company name shouldn't change
// The test specifically checks that we're using 'const' here
const companyName = 'Scuber';

// Step 2: Declare mostProfitableNeighborhood using 'let'
// We use 'let' because the most profitable neighborhood could change over time
// The test checks that we're using 'let' and that the initial value is 'Chelsea'
let mostProfitableNeighborhood = 'Chelsea';

// Step 3: Declare companyCeo using 'let'
// Similar to mostProfitableNeighborhood, we use 'let' because the CEO could change
// The test verifies we're using 'let' and that the initial value is 'Susan Smith'
let companyCeo = 'Susan Smith';

// These declarations satisfy all the requirements specified in the tests:
// 1. companyName is declared with 'const' and set to 'Scuber'
// 2. mostProfitableNeighborhood is declared with 'let' and set to 'Chelsea'
// 3. companyCeo is declared with 'let' and set to 'Susan Smith'n
